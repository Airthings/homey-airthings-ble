This app has been deprecated in favour of the new, cloud based version! You can find it by searching on Airthings in the Homey store.

This deprecated app adds support for Airthings radon/voc sensors over Bluetooth Low Energy.

Airthings and Homey will communicate over Bluetooth, which is limited in range. Make sure that Homey and the device will be max 10 meters in distance to each other, and if possible no obstacles in between (like fireplaces, brick wall, metal walls etc).

When pairing the device for the first time it is recommended to move Homey and the device close to each other to make adding process easier.
